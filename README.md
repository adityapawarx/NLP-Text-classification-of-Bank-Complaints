## Overview

The **"NLP All Models"** notebook showcases the implementation of multiple NLP models which can be used for various language-related tasks such as text classification, tokenization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and more. The notebook aims to be a resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the NLP field to explore and compare different NLP models.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Essential NLP libraries such as:
  - `transformers` (for pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, etc.)
  - `spacy` (for natural language processing and linguistics)
  - `nltk` (for traditional NLP tasks)
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (for data manipulation)
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning models)


 ## Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone this repository.
Ensure all dependencies are installed (see Requirements).
Open the notebook (nlp_all_models.ipynb) in Jupyter:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook nlp_all_models.ipynb
Follow the instructions and explanations provided in the notebook to explore the various NLP models implemented.
File Structure
The following is the structure of the repository:

├── nlp_all_models.ipynb    # Main notebook demonstrating NLP models
├── README.md               # This README file
├── data/                   # (Optional) Folder for storing datasets used in the notebook
└── models/                 # (Optional) Folder for saving/loading NLP models


## NLP Models
The notebook explores various NLP models such as:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text classification and other tasks.
GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) for language generation.
LSTM/GRU models for sequential text data.
TF-IDF + Naive Bayes/SVM for traditional text classification tasks.
SpaCy for tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and dependency parsing.
NLTK for basic text processing such as tokenization, stemming, and more.
Each model section includes code, explanations, and example outputs to illustrate how the model is used in practice.
